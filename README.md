## CCJS 200 Statistics for Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 

### Course Syllabus

* Catalog description: Introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics, graphical techniques, and the computer analysis of criminology and criminal justice data. Basic procedures of hypothesis testing, correlation and regression analysis, and the analysis of continuous and binary dependent variables. Emphasis upon the examination of research problems and issues in criminology and criminal justice. Prerequisite: CCJS100 or CCJS105; and 1 course with a minimum grade of C- from (STAT100, MATH107, MATH111, MATH120, MATH130, MATH135, MATH140). Restriction: Must be in Criminology and Criminal Justice program; or permission of BSOS-Criminology & Criminal Justice department.
* Meetings: This course is scheduled to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11-12:15pm in LeFrak 2205 and I plan to hold office hours on Wednesdays from 10-12pm. My office is 2139 LeFrak Hall. 
* Discussion sections: This course has 6 weekly 50-minute discussion sections that meet on Fridays at various times (9am, 10am, 11am, 12 noon, 1pm, and 2pm). Please sign up for the time that works best for you (up to the enrollment limits) and plan to attend the section for which you are registered. Discussion section attendance is monitored.
* Graduate teaching assistants: Marshae Capers (office hours on Thursday: 12:30-2:00) and Xinyi (Sammy) Situ (office hours: Tuesday 12:30-2:00) will be assisting with the class this semester and will be responsible for overseeing the discussion sections. You can contact them on ELMS. Sammy will be teaching the Friday discussion sections at 9, 11, and 1; Marshae will be teaching at 10, 12, and 2.
* Course-related policies: In all matters, the class will follow University guidance as outlined [here](https://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).
* Accessibility accommodations: If you think you might need one or more academic accommodations, please contact the Accessibility and Disability Service Office ([link](https://ads.umd.edu)) for guidance and assistance. Please contact me on ELMS to set up an appointment to discuss any accommodations that are authorized.
* Required textbook: Weisburd, David and Chester L. Britt (2007). *Statistics in Criminal Justice* (3rd Edition). New York: Springer-Verlag. This book is available as a free pdf download from the University of Maryland Library ([link](https://usmai-umcp.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9963921939908238&context=L&vid=01USMAI_UMCP:UMCP&lang=en&search_scope=DN_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,weisburd%20britt%20statistics%20in%20criminal%20justice)).
* Class notes and out-of-class assignments will be posted on this webpage.
* Letter grades: At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale (A+ = 98 and higher; A = 92-97; A- = 90-91; B+ = 88-89; B = 82-87; B- = 80-81; C+ = for 78-79; C = 72-77; C- = 70-71; D+ = 68-69; D = 62-67; D- = 60-61; and F = any grade less than 60). All numeric grades (including the final numeric grade in the class at the end of the semester) will be rounded off to the nearest 1 point (for example, a 78.5 would be rounded to a 79 and a 78.4 would be rounded to a 78).
* Numeric grades in this class will be based on 3 in-class exams and 3 out-of-class assignments and will all be graded on a 100-point scale. The final numeric grade calculation at the end of the semester will be: 0.25 × Exam 1 + 0.25 × Exam 2 + 0.25 × Exam 3 + 0.25 × Average Assignment Grade.
* Assignment submission rules: assignments are due on ELMS at 11:59pm on the due date and must be submitted as a pdf file. If you submit your assignment in any other form than a pdf file, you will receive an automatic 10-point deduction.  It is your responsibility to make sure the pdf file you submit can be opened and read. File submissions that cannot be opened or read will receive a grade of 0. In the unlikely event that there is an ELMS or Canvas problem at the deadline time, you can submit your assignment to me by email (rbrame@umd.edu) but the time stamp of the email will be marked as the submission time. Such emails must originate from your UMD email account or they will not be accepted.
* Late submission of assignments: If you submit your assignment after the 11:59pm deadline, there will be a 5-point grade penalty for each hour the submission is late (so, for a submission arriving at midnight up through 12:59am, the penalty is 5 points; if the submission arrives at 1:00am up through 1:59am, the penalty is 10 points, etc.). If an emergency arises and you are unable to submit your assignment, you are expected to notify me no later than the time the assignment is due and to supply appropriate documentation to support your excuse. The documentation must demonstrate incapacity to work on the assignment for a substantial fraction of the time between when the assignment is posted and the time it is due. If the emergency is such that you are unable to notify me by the time the assignment is due, your excuse must also include documentation to justify the delay in notification. Once I have reviewed the documentation, I will make a judgment about whether an extension is warranted.
* Attendance expectations for classes and discussion sections: My expectation is that you will attend all of the class and discussion sessions. If you have to miss a class or a discussion session, I encourage you to work with other people in the class to get caught up on your notes and contact me or the TAs if you need clarification. Discussion section attendance will be monitored.
* Attendance expectations for exams: If you have to miss an exam, we will follow the notification and make-up policies specified by the University (see this [webpage](https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/registration-academic-requirements-regulations/academic-records-regulations/#absences-assessment-attendance-syllabus)). Those guidelines require that such notifications be *timely* and supported by *appropriate documentation.* The definition of "timely" used in this course is notification before the exam begins. Valid excuses are those listed in the University policies linked above and accompanied by appropriate documentation. Notification after the exam begins will be considered but there must be a compelling reason for the notification delay. Any student who has 3 exams scheduled on the same day may request an accommodation.
* Key dates: (1) first class day - Tuesday 1/28; (2) spring break - 3/17-3/21; (3) last day of class - Tuesday 5/13; and (4) scheduled final exam period - Thursday 5/15 from 10:30am-12:30pm. *Note*: exam and assignment due dates are listed in the course outline below.
* Statistical software: As noted in the catalog description, there is a computer component to this course. We will be using R, which is free for you to install on your own computer and is widely available on University computers across campus.
* Academic integrity: the guiding principle in this class is that the work you submit should be your own work. For in-class exams, this means you will not look at other students' papers or unauthorized materials when you are working on your exam. For assigments, this means you are not permitted to discuss assignment problems with other students, share R code to solve assignment problems with other students, or use artificial intelligence to obtain R code or to solve assignment problems. If credible evidence of a rule violation materializes, it will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in accordance with the University's Academic Integrity Policy ([website](https://policies.umd.edu/academic-affairs/university-of-maryland-code-of-academic-integrity)). Please note that an Academic Integrity referral does *not* mean that you have been found responsible for a violation or that I have concluded you are responsible for a violation. It means that an issue of concern has been noted and that the Office of Student Conduct will examine it carefully. A determination of responsibility will only be reached after the Office of Student Conduct has completed its investigation with appropriate due process; as an instructor, my role in the process is a limited one. 

### Frequently Asked Questions

* Why do I have to take this course?

The University of Maryland has a General Education curriculum [(link)](https://gened.umd.edu/node/35) which all baccalaureate-level degree recipients must complete. Part of this curriculum is called Fundamental Studies and successful completion of this course (CCJS 200) satisfies the Fundamental Studies Analytic Reasoning (FSAR) requirement. So, when you see FSAR labels associated with this course, that is what those labels refer to. The Analytic Reasoning requirement expresses a belief among the University faculty that analytic reasoning is an essential part of what it means to have received a liberal arts education.

* What does UMD expect us to cover in a class that satisfies the University's analytic reasoning requirement?

According to the Gen-Ed [website](https://gened.umd.edu/students/four-categories/fundamental-studies), "[c]courses in Analytic Reasoning foster a student's ability to use mathematical or formal methods or structured protocols and patterns of reasoning to examine problems or issues by evaluating evidence, examining proofs, analyzing relationships between variables, developing arguments, and drawing conclusions appropriately. Courses in this category advance and build upon the skills that students develop in Fundamental Mathematics."

* Why is this course taught in the CCJS department?

The disciplinary focus of this course reflects a belief by the faculty that analytic reasoning skills can be usefully conveyed through the disciplinary lens of the student's major. The alternative would be to teach a course like this in a math or statistics department and, indeed, this is what is done at some universities. There is no right or wrong way to deliver this kind of course; what we have at Maryland reflects the views of the faculty who work here.

* I don't like math and I'm apprehensive about taking this course. Can you help me feel better about this?

It just so happens that when criminologists do research and evaluation work, they often rely on quantitative data and so it came to pass that we have this class which emphasizes "statistical analysis." Even though you will be performing some calculations and working with some numeric data in this class, the calculations you will be doing are probably best viewed as *arithmetic*. This is to emphasize that all of the calculating in this class will be focused on addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. Discussion sections and office hours are the appropriate venue for getting help with the practice problems. The University also offers the [Math Success Program](https://tltc.umd.edu/students/get-help-class/math-success-program) which may be helpful to you.

* What will I be able to do when this course is over?

These are the course learning outcomes which I have defined as your being able to: (1) explain the meaning and limitations of commonly used statistics related to crime and criminal justice; (2) describe the concepts of point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing; (3) analyze certain kinds of quantitative criminological evidence, considering both the strengths and weaknesses of methodological approaches often used in our discipline; and (4) perform basic statistical calculations related to criminologically interesting phenomena. 

* Will there be homework?

Yes, I will regularly give you example questions and problems to complete outside of class. Some will come from the textbook and I will create some myself. 

* What will the assignments be like in this class?

You will have 3 out-of-class assignments in this course; each assignment will consist of substantive and computer-related applications of key concepts presented in class. If you have a question about an assignment, you are free to ask me or the TAs, up until 12 hours before the assignment is due. If a question we receive seems to be of interest to the entire class, we will post that question and the answer to the question on the course webpage so everyone can see the question and the answer. 

* What will the exams be like?
  
Exams will involve pencil and paper questions, problems, and calculations that will be similar to those you work on outside of class. For these exams, you will need to have a calculator which can take square roots. The exams are closed-book but a formula sheet will be provided. Before each exam, I will set aside class time for review. On exam days, the full class period will be devoted to the exam. The exams in this class are not designed to be cumulative but the material we cover later in the class does build on concepts learned earlier, so please keep that in mind.

* Do I have to show my work to get credit?

When complex or multi-step calculations are involved, you must show your work (including intermediate steps), to receive full credit on an exam or assignment question. If you get an incorrect answer on an assignment or an exam, you may still be able to get partial credit if we judge that important intermediate steps were done correctly.

* What happens in discussion sections?

Marshae and Sammy will be the CCJS 200 teaching assistants this semester and they will oversee the discussion sections each Friday. They are both Ph.D. students in our program who are well versed in the concepts and materials we are studying this semester. During the discussion sections, Marshae and Sammy will be answering lecture- and assignment-related questions. They will also go over some of the practice problems at the end of the textbook chapters. They are a valuable resource for you this semester and I encourage you to fully engage with the discussion section each week. Please note that the discussion sections are designed to be smaller class sizes where you can get help with homework problems and questions pertaining to the class so it is important that you attend the section for which you registered. 

* How do I obtain and use R?

R is available at this [website](https://www.r-project.org). You can read about the history of R (it was originally developed at Bell Labs and used to be called S and then S+) at the Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). To work with R, you will need to use a plain text editor (Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac OS). You can use R on your own computer or you may access it on the OACS workstations in the basement of LeFrak Hall ([website](https://oacs.umd.edu/facilities/oacs-computer-labs)). The R system serves as a reminder that some important things in science and in life are still free.

#### Topic 2 begins here

* 2.1: # of murders for Philadelphia in 2018 ([link](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/pennsylvania.xls))
* 2.2: we can use the information in 2.1 to calculate the Philadelphia *murder rate* in 2018.

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig1.png" width="750px">
</p>

* 2.3: now, let's look at the murders in Philadelphia for the year 2019:



#### Practice Questions (no questions at the end of Chapter 1 so I'm making up a few)

* The death penalty is morally wrong. (empirical or normative?)
* Death penalty states have higher murder rates than non-death penalty states (empirical or normative?)
* When a new neighborhood police station opened in neighborhood X, reported robberies declined by 10% (empirical or normative?)
* Average age of first criminal offense (criminology or criminal justice?)
* Percentage of cases in a domestic violence court resolved with a plea bargain (criminology or criminal justice?)
* Suppose we survey every 5th house on a 3-mile street. Is this a sample or a population?
* Is the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) based on a sample or a population?
* Consider the following dataset of El Paso murders: 

| Year  | N = |
| -----:| --: |
| 2014  | 21 |
| 2015  | 17 |
| 2016  | 17 |
| 2017  | 19 |
| 2018  | 23 |
| 2019  | 40 |
| 2020  | 23 |

Which of these years seems to be an *outlier*? How does it affect our ability to summarize the yearly number of murders in El Paso during this particular 7-year time period? How should we address it in an analysis?
