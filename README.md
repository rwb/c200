## CCJS 200 Statistics for Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 

### Course Syllabus

* Catalog description: Introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics, graphical techniques, and the computer analysis of criminology and criminal justice data. Basic procedures of hypothesis testing, correlation and regression analysis, and the analysis of continuous and binary dependent variables. Emphasis upon the examination of research problems and issues in criminology and criminal justice. Prerequisite: CCJS100 or CCJS105; and 1 course with a minimum grade of C- from (STAT100, MATH107, MATH111, MATH120, MATH130, MATH135, MATH140). Restriction: Must be in Criminology and Criminal Justice program; or permission of BSOS-Criminology & Criminal Justice department.
* Meetings and Contact Information: This course is scheduled to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11-12:15pm in LeFrak 2205 and I plan to hold office hours on Wednesdays from 10-12pm (or by appointment). My office is 2139 LeFrak Hall. My email address is rbrame at umd.edu. My preference is that you contact me on ELMS but you can email me if needed. Please do not email me from non-University email accounts.
* Discussion sections: This course has 6 weekly 50-minute discussion sections that meet on Fridays at various times (9am, 10am, 11am, 12 noon, 1pm, and 2pm). Please sign up for the time that works best for you (up to the enrollment limits) and plan to attend the section for which you are registered. Discussion section attendance is monitored.
* Graduate teaching assistants: Marshae Capers (office hours on Thursday: 12:30-2:00) and Xinyi (Sammy) Situ (office hours: Tuesday 12:30-2:00) will be assisting with the class this semester and will be responsible for overseeing the discussion sections. You can contact them on ELMS. Sammy will be teaching the Friday discussion sections at 9, 11, and 1; Marshae will be teaching at 10, 12, and 2. Their office is located in 2163 LeFrak Hall.
* Course-related policies: In all matters, the class will follow University guidance as outlined [here](https://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).
* Accessibility accommodations: If you think you might need one or more academic accommodations, please contact the Accessibility and Disability Service Office ([link](https://ads.umd.edu)) for guidance and assistance. Please contact me on ELMS to set up an appointment to discuss any accommodations that are authorized.
* Required textbook: Weisburd, David and Chester L. Britt (2007). *Statistics in Criminal Justice* (3rd Edition). New York: Springer-Verlag. This book is available as a free pdf download from the University of Maryland Library ([link](https://usmai-umcp.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9963921939908238&context=L&vid=01USMAI_UMCP:UMCP&lang=en&search_scope=DN_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,weisburd%20britt%20statistics%20in%20criminal%20justice)).
* Class notes and out-of-class assignments will be posted on this webpage.
* Letter grades: At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale (A+ = 98 and higher; A = 92-97; A- = 90-91; B+ = 88-89; B = 82-87; B- = 80-81; C+ = for 78-79; C = 72-77; C- = 70-71; D+ = 68-69; D = 62-67; D- = 60-61; and F = any grade less than 60). All numeric grades (including the final numeric grade in the class at the end of the semester) will be rounded off to the nearest 1 point (for example, a 78.5 would be rounded to a 79 and a 78.4 would be rounded to a 78).
* Numeric grades in this class will be based on 3 in-class exams and 3 out-of-class assignments and will all be graded on a 100-point scale. The final numeric grade calculation at the end of the semester will be: 0.25 × Exam 1 + 0.25 × Exam 2 + 0.25 × Exam 3 + 0.25 × Average Assignment Grade.
* Assignment submission rules: assignments are due on ELMS at 11:59pm on the due date and must be submitted as a pdf file. If you submit your assignment in any other form than a pdf file, you will receive an automatic 10-point deduction.  It is your responsibility to make sure the pdf file you submit can be opened and read. File submissions that cannot be opened or read will receive a grade of 0. In the unlikely event that there is an ELMS or Canvas problem at the deadline time, you can submit your assignment to me by email (rbrame@umd.edu) but the time stamp of the email will be marked as the submission time. Such emails must originate from your UMD email account or they will not be accepted.
* Late submission of assignments: If you submit your assignment after the 11:59pm deadline, there will be a 5-point grade penalty for each hour the submission is late (so, for a submission arriving at midnight up through 12:59am, the penalty is 5 points; if the submission arrives at 1:00am up through 1:59am, the penalty is 10 points, etc.). If an emergency arises and you are unable to submit your assignment, you are expected to notify me no later than the time the assignment is due and to supply appropriate documentation to support your excuse. The documentation must demonstrate incapacity to work on the assignment for a substantial fraction of the time between when the assignment is posted and the time it is due. If the emergency is such that you are unable to notify me by the time the assignment is due, your excuse must also include documentation to justify the delay in notification. Once I have reviewed the documentation, I will make a judgment about whether an extension is warranted.
* Attendance expectations for classes and discussion sections: My expectation is that you will attend all of the class and discussion sessions. If you have to miss a class or a discussion session, I encourage you to work with other people in the class to get caught up on your notes and contact me or the TAs if you need clarification. Discussion section attendance will be monitored. 
* Attendance expectations for exams: If you have to miss an exam, we will follow the notification and make-up policies specified by the University (see this [webpage](https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/registration-academic-requirements-regulations/academic-records-regulations/#absences-assessment-attendance-syllabus)). Those guidelines require that such notifications be *timely* and supported by *appropriate documentation.* The definition of "timely" used in this course is notification before the exam begins. Valid excuses are those listed in the University policies linked above and accompanied by appropriate documentation. Notification after the exam begins will be considered but there must be a compelling reason for the notification delay. Any student who has 3 exams scheduled on the same day may request an accommodation.
* Key dates: (1) first class day - Tuesday 1/28; (2) spring break - 3/17-3/21; (3) last day of class - Tuesday 5/13; and (4) scheduled final exam period - Thursday 5/15 from 10:30am-12:30pm. *Note*: exam and assignment due dates are listed in the course outline below.
* Statistical software: As noted in the catalog description, there is a computer component to this course. We will be using R, which is free for you to install on your own computer and is widely available on University computers across campus.
* Academic integrity: the guiding principle in this class is that the work you submit should be your own work. For in-class exams, this means you will not look at other students' papers or unauthorized materials when you are working on your exam. For assigments, this means you are not permitted to discuss assignment problems with other students, share R code to solve assignment problems with other students, or use artificial intelligence to obtain R code or to solve assignment problems. If credible evidence of a rule violation materializes, it will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in accordance with the University's Academic Integrity Policy ([website](https://policies.umd.edu/academic-affairs/university-of-maryland-code-of-academic-integrity)). Please note that an Academic Integrity referral does *not* mean that you have been found responsible for a violation or that I have concluded you are responsible for a violation. It means that an issue of concern has been noted and that the Office of Student Conduct will examine it carefully. A determination of responsibility will only be reached after the Office of Student Conduct has completed its investigation with appropriate due process; as an instructor, my role in the process is a limited one. 

### Frequently Asked Questions

* Why do I have to take this course?

The University of Maryland has a General Education curriculum [(link)](https://gened.umd.edu/node/35) which all baccalaureate-level degree recipients must complete. Part of this curriculum is called Fundamental Studies and successful completion of this course (CCJS 200) satisfies the Fundamental Studies Analytic Reasoning (FSAR) requirement. So, when you see FSAR labels associated with this course, that is what those labels refer to. The Analytic Reasoning requirement expresses a belief among the University faculty that analytic reasoning is an essential part of what it means to have received a liberal arts education.

* What does UMD expect us to cover in a class that satisfies the University's analytic reasoning requirement?

According to the Gen-Ed [website](https://gened.umd.edu/students/four-categories/fundamental-studies), "[c]courses in Analytic Reasoning foster a student's ability to use mathematical or formal methods or structured protocols and patterns of reasoning to examine problems or issues by evaluating evidence, examining proofs, analyzing relationships between variables, developing arguments, and drawing conclusions appropriately. Courses in this category advance and build upon the skills that students develop in Fundamental Mathematics."

* Why is this course taught in the CCJS department?

The disciplinary focus of this course reflects a belief by the faculty that analytic reasoning skills can be usefully conveyed through the disciplinary lens of the student's major. The alternative would be to teach a course like this in a math or statistics department and, indeed, this is what is done at some universities. There is no right or wrong way to deliver this kind of course; what we have at Maryland reflects the views of the faculty who work here.

* I don't like math and I'm apprehensive about taking this course. Can you help me feel better about this?

It just so happens that when criminologists do research and evaluation work, they often rely on quantitative data and so it came to pass that we have this class which emphasizes "statistical analysis." Even though you will be performing some calculations and working with some numeric data in this class, the calculations you will be doing are probably best viewed as *arithmetic*. This is to emphasize that all of the calculating in this class will be focused on addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. Discussion sections and office hours are the appropriate venue for getting help with the practice problems. The University also offers the [Math Success Program](https://tltc.umd.edu/students/get-help-class/math-success-program) which may be helpful to you.

* What will I be able to do when this course is over?

These are the course learning outcomes which I have defined as your being able to: (1) explain the meaning and limitations of commonly used statistics related to crime and criminal justice; (2) describe the concepts of point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing; (3) analyze certain kinds of quantitative criminological evidence, considering both the strengths and weaknesses of methodological approaches often used in our discipline; and (4) perform basic statistical calculations related to criminologically interesting phenomena. 

* Will there be homework?

Yes, I will regularly give you example questions and problems to complete outside of class. Some will come from the textbook and I will create some myself. 

* What will the assignments be like in this class?

You will have 3 out-of-class assignments in this course; each assignment will consist of substantive and computer-related applications of key concepts presented in class. If you have a question about an assignment, you are free to ask me or the TAs, up until 12 hours before the assignment is due. If a question we receive seems to be of interest to the entire class, we will post that question and the answer to the question on the course webpage so everyone can see the question and the answer. 

* What will the exams be like?
  
Exams will involve pencil and paper questions, problems, and calculations that will be similar to those you work on outside of class. For these exams, you will need to have a calculator which can take square roots. The exams are closed-book but a formula sheet will be provided. Before each exam, I will set aside class time for review. On exam days, the full class period will be devoted to the exam. The exams in this class are not designed to be cumulative but the material we cover later in the class does build on concepts learned earlier, so please keep that in mind.

* Do I have to show my work to get credit?

When complex or multi-step calculations are involved, you must show your work (including intermediate steps), to receive full credit on an exam or assignment question. If you get an incorrect answer on an assignment or an exam, you may still be able to get partial credit if we judge that important intermediate steps were done correctly.

* What happens in discussion sections?

Marshae and Sammy will be the CCJS 200 teaching assistants this semester and they will oversee the discussion sections each Friday. They are both Ph.D. students in our program who are well versed in the concepts and materials we are studying this semester. During the discussion sections, Marshae and Sammy will be answering lecture- and assignment-related questions. They will also go over some of the practice problems at the end of the textbook chapters. They are a valuable resource for you this semester and I encourage you to fully engage with the discussion section each week. Please note that the discussion sections are designed to be smaller class sizes where you can get help with homework problems and questions pertaining to the class so it is important that you attend the section for which you registered. *This Note Added on 2/5/25*: If an unavoidable conflict arises, it is permissible to change discussion sections but you must send a written request to your TA on ELMS so that we have a record of the change. I do ask you to keep such changes to a minimum because we want the discussion sections to be small so everyone can get the help they need.

* How do I obtain and use R?

R is available at this [website](https://www.r-project.org). You can read about the history of R (it was originally developed at Bell Labs and used to be called S and then S+) at the Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). To work with R, you will need to use a plain text editor (Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac OS). You can use R on your own computer or you may access it on the OACS workstations in the basement of LeFrak Hall ([website](https://oacs.umd.edu/facilities/oacs-computer-labs)). The R system serves as a reminder that some important things in science and in life are still free.

```

* 1.17: p. 9: samples and populations: often we can't study an entire population so we study a sample.
* 1.18: pp. 10-11: multivariate statistics: measuring cause and effect often requires that we pay attention to multiple factors at the same time. Example: job attachment and crime (need to account for age)

#### Topic 2 begins here

* 2.1: # of murders for Philadelphia in 2018 ([link](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/pennsylvania.xls))
* 2.2: we can use the information in 2.1 to calculate the Philadelphia *murder rate* in 2018.

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig1.png" width="750px">
</p>

* 2.3: now, let's look at the murders in Philadelphia for the year 2019 ([link](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/pennsylvania.xls)):

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig2.png" width="750px">
</p>

* 2.4: Participation in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program is *voluntary*.
* 2.5: Each year, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) publishes a set of crime victimization statistics for the nation.
* 2.6: These statistics are based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).
* 2.7: The NCVS is survey data based on a sample of U.S. households.
* 2.8: An important feature of the NCVS is its measure of *crimes reported to the police*.
* 2.9: Here is a [link](https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/cv23.pdf) to the most recent (2023) report.
* 2.10: The *crimes reported to the police* table is on page 6 of the report.
* 2.11: Notice the change in the percentage of robberies reported to the police from 2022 to 2023.

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig3.png" width="500px">
</p>

* 2.12: From time to time, the Bureau of Justice Statistics publishes reports documenting *recidivism* patterns among people being released from prison. The table below summarizes the recidivism patterns for people released from prison in 15 states during the year 1994 ([link](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rpr94.pdf)):

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig4.png" width="400px">
</p>

#### Week 1 Practice Questions (no questions at the end of Chapter 1 so I'm making up a few)

* The death penalty is morally wrong. (empirical or normative?)
* Death penalty states have higher murder rates than non-death penalty states (empirical or normative?)
* When a new neighborhood police station opened in neighborhood X, reported robberies declined by 10% (empirical or normative?)
* Average age of first criminal offense (criminology or criminal justice?)
* Percentage of cases in a domestic violence court resolved with a plea bargain (criminology or criminal justice?)
* Suppose we survey every 5th house on a 3-mile street. Is this a sample or a population?
* Is the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) based on a sample or a population?
* Consider the following dataset of El Paso murders: 

| Year  | N = |
| -----:| --: |
| 2014  | 21 |
| 2015  | 17 |
| 2016  | 17 |
| 2017  | 19 |
| 2018  | 23 |
| 2019  | 40 |
| 2020  | 23 |

Which of these years seems to be an *outlier*? How does it affect our ability to summarize the yearly number of murders in El Paso during this particular 7-year time period? How should we address it in an analysis?
* Consult the Uniform Crime Reports for Charlotte-Mecklenburg North Carolina in [2018](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/north-carolina.xls) and [2019](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/north_carolina.xls). Calculate the murder rate for each year. What conclusion do you draw about the change in the murder rate for Charlotte from 2018 to 2019.
* Review the National Crime Victimization Survey Report for 2019 ([link](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv19.pdf)). Find the table presenting crime victimizations reported to the police. Describe the change you see in the percentage of robberies reported to the police from 2018 to 2019.

### Lesson 3 - Tuesday 2/4/25

* 2.13: When reviewing the recidivism table presented last class, two key patterns are evident: (1) how recidivism rates accumulate over time; and (2) how recidivism rates vary depending on the measure of recidivism (arrest, conviction, imprisonment). The chart below presents the same information graphically:

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig5.png" width="500px">
</p>

* 2.14: For all of the crime statistics I have presented so far, the emphasis has been on point estimation; that is, estimation of a single number or a small set of numbers. Interval estimates provide a range of uncertainty for the point estimate. This is a more advanced topic which we will address later in the course.
* 2.15: Let's look at Table 8 in the same report. Among other things, this table shows us the relationship between age and recidivism. What can we conclude about that relationship based on the information in the table?

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig6.png" width="500px">
</p>

* 2.16: Murders in Oklahoma City during the 1990's:
  
| Year  | N = |
| -----:| --: |
| 1992  | 61 |
| 1993  | 80 |
| 1994  | 65 |
| 1995  | 227 |
| 1996  | 67 |
| 1997  | 59 |
| 1998  | 56 |

Clearly, 1995 is an outlier (due to the bombing of a federal building in April 1995). How should we deal with it? We could calculate an average both with and without the outlier included:

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig7.png" width="500px">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig8.png" width="500px">
</p>

*Note*: this is a case where it would be reasonable to present 2 answers instead of 1.

* 2.17: Crime clearances are a significant research topic; they relate to accountability, justice, police performance, and police-community relations. Let's look at murder clearances in Baltimore for the year 2023. (Note: these data are based on information compiled by the FBI and tabulated by https://crimedatatool.com).

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig10.png" width="700px">
</p>

The total number of murders was 233 and the number of clearances was 82. This produces a *clearance rate* of 82/233 $\approx$ 35.193 clearances per 100 murders.

* 2.18: Clearances are regularly tabulated for so-called Part I index crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson. We'll take a look at the thefts and theft clearances in Buffalo, NY in 2017 (again, tabulated by https://crimedatatool.com):

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig9.png" width="700px">
</p>

The yearly clearance rate cannot be calculated from these numbers since two months are missing clearance information. It is important to note that a murder or theft occurring in one year might not be cleared until the next year so it is not accurate to think of the clearance rate as a fraction.

*Note*: these are all examples of descriptive statistics: they tell us what is *typical* and they tell us how much *variability* there is. When we try to learn what is typical, we use measures of central tendency. When we try to learn about the variation in the data, we use measures of *dispersion* (these terms are discussed on pp. 7-9 in your textbook).

#### Chapter 2/Topic 3 begins here

Criminologists often converse about fairly broad concepts. Terms like crime rates, recidivism, homicide, delinquency, incarceration, and plea bargaining are often used in fairly loose and informal ways. To do research, we must become more specific in defining the terms that we use. Toward this end, chapter 3 considers the idea of *measurement*: the process by which we transition from abstract concepts to actual research exercises like classification and counting. 

* 3.1: Positivism: the empirical study of scientifically interesting phenomena; as opposed to advocacy or opinions (normative reasoning).
* 3.2: Measurement involves placing study *units* into categories or on a continuum so that we can see the variation that exists.
* 3.3: Variables are traits, characteristics, or attributes that can be used to differentiate study *units*.
* 3.4: A *unit* or *unit of analysis* is the main focus of a study.
* 3.5: Example: the unit of analysis in a study describing the variation in crime across neighborhoods within a city is the neighborhood.
* 3.6: Example: the unit of analysis in a study examining the probability that an individual person has been a victim of a crime within the past year is the individual person.
* 3.7: The categories or distinct values of some variables represent qualitative differences or *differences in kind*.
* 3.8: The categories or distinct values of other variables represent quantitative differences or *differences in degree*.
* 3.9: This leads us to the topic of *levels of measurement* which corresponds to the meaning we can assign to the differences between categories.
* 3.10: 4 levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
* 3.11: A nominal scale variable represents purely qualitative differences; the arrangement or ordering of the categories is not important.
* 3.12: Examples of nominal scale variables: sex, race, religious affiliation.
* 3.13: An ordinal scale variable involves qualitative differences but the ordering of the categories is significant. An ambiguity in ordinal variables is that the distance between the categories is not well defined.
* 3.14: Examples of ordinal scale variables: Likert-type scales (1=strongly agree, 2=agree, 3=disagree, 4=strongly disagree); severity of head injuries in motorcycle accidents (Weiss, 1992:49; [link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2290450.pdf)).

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig11.png" width="700px">
</p>

* 3.15: Interval scale variables have many ordered values but no true zero.
* 3.16: Examples of interval scale variables: IQ scores, certain kinds of risk assessment scores (for example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons Risk Assessment, [link](https://www.bop.gov/inmates/fsa/pattern.jsp)):

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig12.png" width="500px">
</p>

*Note*: this particular example illustrates how we can *collapse* or *reduce* an interval level variable to an ordinal level of measurement.

*Note*: A problem is that the dividing line between an ordinal variable and an interval variable can be somewhat ambiguous (i.e., how many categories do we need to have before we decide that a variable is no longer an ordinal variable and is now an interval variable?).

* 3.17: Ratio scale variables have many ordered values plus there is a true zero (which represents the absence of the phenomenon).
* 3.18: Examples of ratio scale variables: speed at which a car is driving; the number of months an offender is sentenced to prison; age at which a person is arrested for the first time.
* 3.19: The scale of measurement is, therefore, based on the amount of information we have plus the nature of the phenomenon (variable) that is being studied.
* 3.20: Please see the other examples in Tables 2.1-2.3 of your textbook.
* 3.21: The textbook (pp. 22-23) urges us to collect data at the highest level possible. For example, if we collect data at the interval or ratio level, we can always combine categories to get an ordinal scale; but if the data are collected at the ordinal level, we cannot increase the level of measurement to the interval or ratio level.

### Lesson 4 - Thursday 2/6/25

* 4.1: Validity (pp. 23-24): does the measurement accurately reflect the concept that is being measured (acronym: MARC). So validity pertains to accuracy of measurement.
* 4.2: Textbook example: measuring criminal offending: (1) self-report surveys; or RAP (record of arrest and prosecution) sheet information including - (2) arrest records; (3) conviction records; and (4) incarceration records.
* 4.3: On page 24, the textbook argues that "self-report surveys are generally considered to provide the most valid measure of frequency of offending." Yet this measure is not perfect. What could go wrong?
* 4.4: Would a measure based on arrests or convictions be better? Why or why not?
* 4.5: Let's look at an example problem:

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig13.png" width="700px">
</p>

* 4.6: Consider the following research question: how many murders/homicides occurred in Maryland in the year 2019?
* 4.7: There are two major data sources for measuring murders/homicides in the United States: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) measure of murder and non-negligent manslaughter; and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) measure of death by assault (homicide).
* 4.8: Here is the number of murder/non-negligent manslaughter incidents based on the FBI data:

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig14.png" width="500px">
</p>

* 4.9: Here is the number of homicides based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data:

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig15.png" width="900px">
</p>

* 4.10: What can account for the difference? 
* 4.11: Different kinds of validity: (1) content and construct validity; (2) criterion-related and multiple measures validity.
* 4.12: Here is the long-term national comparison of the two data series.

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig16.png" width="700px">
</p>

* 5.1: Reliability (pp. 24-25): repeatability or consistency of the measurement (example: bathroom scale).
* 5.2: Example: suppose I sit near an intersection with a 4-way stop sign for 3 hours. I count the number of cars that go through the intersection and I also count the number of cars that fail to come to a complete stop. Do you have any concerns about the reliability of the measurement? How could we improve it?
* 5.3: Relationship between reliability and validity: a measure can be reliable but not valid; if a measure is unreliable it is also invalid.

#### Introduction to R

* Here is where you go to get R software for your computer: [link](https://www.r-project.org).
* If you don't have a computer, you can use R in the Office of Academic Computing Services Lab on the bottom floor of LeFrak Hall.
* R is also widely available on computers across campus.
* Once you have R downloaded on your computer, you are ready to launch the application.
* You should write your code in a *plain text editor* (Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on MacOS).
* Do not use Microsoft Word or any other word processor to write R code. It will cause problems!
* You can paste your output into a word processor as you prepare your assignments so I can see your work and your results.
* Let's revisit the Oklahoma City murder data above and enter this data into R.

```R
murders=c(61,80,65,227,67,59,56)
year=1992:1998
data.frame(year,murders)
```
* Here is the output we get:
```Rout
> murders=c(61,80,65,227,67,59,56)
> year=1992:1998
> data.frame(year,murders)
  year murders
1 1992      61
2 1993      80
3 1994      65
4 1995     227
5 1996      67
6 1997      59
7 1998      56
>
```
* Now suppose we want to know the total number of murders that occurred over the entire 7-year period:

```R
sum(murders)
```

which gives:

```Rout
> sum(murders)
[1] 615
>
```
* Now, let's suppose I want to calculate the average yearly number of murders:

```R
sum(murders)/7
```

which gives:

```Rout
> sum(murders)/7
[1] 87.85714
>
```
* The average, or mean, is a measure of typicality or *central tendency*.
* You should verify that this is the same number we got before.
* We could also calculate the average removing the outlier:

```R
(sum(murders)-227)/6
```
which gives us this result:

```Rout
> (sum(murders)-227)/6
[1] 64.66667
>
```
* Finally, let's suppose that we want to calculate the *murder rate* for each of the 7 years.
* Let's start a new R session.
* To calculate the rate, we need to include the population for each of the 7 years.
* We go to [crimedatatool.com](https://crimedatatool.com) to get the data.

```R
year=1992:1998
murders=c(61,80,65,227,67,59,56)
population=c(454255,457448,461271,466232,469632,472046,463637)
rate=(murders/population)*100000
data.frame(year,murders,population,rate)
```

```Rout
> year=1992:1998
> murders=c(61,80,65,227,67,59,56)
> population=c(454255,457448,461271,466232,469632,472046,463637)
> rate=(murders/population)*100000
> data.frame(year,murders,population,rate)
  year murders population     rate
1 1992      61     454255 13.42858
2 1993      80     457448 17.48833
3 1994      65     461271 14.09150
4 1995     227     466232 48.68821
5 1996      67     469632 14.26649
6 1997      59     472046 12.49878
7 1998      56     463637 12.07841
>
```
* Which year has the highest murder rate?
* Which year has the lowest murder rate?
* Considering the 7 years, which year has the median murder rate?

```R
sort(rate)
```

which gives us the following output:

```Rout
> sort(rate)
[1] 12.07841 12.49878 13.42858 14.09150 14.26649 17.48833
[7] 48.68821
>
```

* Notice that the rates are *sorted* in ascending order.
* The median murder rate is the middle score -- another measure of typicality or central tendency.
* With 7 scores, the middle score is the 4th score (3 scores below the 4th score and 3 scores above the 4th score).
* So, the median is 14.09150.
* And 14.09150 was the murder rate for the year 1994.

#### Week 2 Practice Questions

* Consider the following dataset of the number of murders in New York City reported to the FBI by the New York City Police Department (NYPD):

| Year  | N = |
| -----:| --: |
| 1997  | 770 |
| 1998  | 633 |
| 1999  | 671 |
| 2000  | 673 |
| 2001  | 3472 |
| 2002  | 587 |
| 2003  | 597 |

The year 2001 is an obvious outlier due to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Calculate and report the average yearly number of murders in New York City during this period including and excluding the outlier.
* What is the unit of analysis for the New York City table?
* Examine the BJS recidivism study ([link](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rpr94.pdf)) for people released from prison in 1994. Looking at Table 12 of the report, we see evidence of a relationship between the number of prior arrests and the fraction of people who recidivated within 1 and 3 years. Based on the information in this table, what pattern do you see?
* Calculate the theft clearance rate (# of clearances per 100 cases) for Buffalo for the first 4 months (combined) of 2017. Then, calculate the theft clearance rate for the last 6 months (combined) of 2017. Which of the two clearance rates is greater?
* Problems 2.1-2.8 at the end of chapter 2.

#### R Practice Assignment (I will go over this in class on Tuesday 2/11/25)

* Enter the New York City murders (1997-2003) and years from the table above.
* Go to [crimedatatool.com](https://crimedatatool.com) to get the population sizes for New York City for each of the years.
* Enter the population sizes.
* Calculate the murder rate for each of the years.
* Calculate the average murder rate.
* Find the median murder rate.
* Which year corresponds to the median murder rate?
* Calculate the murder rate for each of the years (using a calculator).
* Calculate the average murder rate (using a calculator)
* Verify that your calculations match those from R out to the 3rd decimal place.
* Remember that you should only round the final answer (not intermediate calculations).
* For this analysis, do you think the mean or the median would be a better measure of central tendency? Why?

### Lesson 5 - Tuesday 2/11/25

*Note*: First assignment will be distributed on Thursday 2/13/24. It will be due on Wednesday 2/19/24 at 11:59pm (ET).

#### Chapter 4 Begins Here

* A primary purpose of descriptive statistics is to transmit information about what is typical.
* Considering a specific variable, we summarize typicality through measures of central tendency (mode, median, and mean)

#### Topic 6 Begins Here

* 6.1: First measure of central tendency: the mode (pp. 60-62). The modal category is the most frequently occurring category, level, or value of a variable.
* 6.2: Mode Example: Sanction for a sample of 100 people cited for littering: (1) Fine (N=22); (2) Civics class (N=25); (3) Community Service (N=53). What is the mode?
```Rout
- the mode is the most frequently occurring category, level or value of a variable.
- in this case, the community service category has the largest number of cases.
- therefore, the mode is "community service"
```
* 6.3: A common mistake in the previous example is to say that the mode is 53. It is correct to say that the mode is community service and the number of cases in the modal category is 53.
* 6.4: It is most natural to use the mode as a measure of central tendency for *nominal* variables (categorical variables with no logical way to order the categories).
* 6.5: The mode can be used with ordinal, interval, and ratio variables but it is often not a particularly meaningful exercise to do so.

#### Topic 7 Begins Here

* 7.1: For variables with order, the median (pp. 62-68) will often be more useful than the mode.
* 7.2: Suppose we ask a sample of 97 people to answer a survey question about how safe they feel walking in their neighborhood in the early evening. Among the 97 people, here are the answers we get back: (1) very unsafe (N=16); (2) somewhat unsafe (N=21); (3) somewhat safe (N=38); (4) very safe (N=22). What is the median safety assessment?

```Rout
- If the number of cases is odd, then the median observation is (n+1)/2
- So, the median observation for our sample is (97+1)/2 = 49
- 16+21 (the sum of the number of people in the first two categories) is 37; 37 < 49
- 16+21+38 (the sum of the number of people in the first three categories) is 75; 75 > 49
- So, the 49th observation lies within the 3rd category (somewhat safe).
- The median score in this example is "somewhat safe".
```
* 7.3: Let's say we conduct a survey of 50 people and we present them with the following statement: Capital punishment (the death penalty) should be a punishment option for the crime of first degree murder. We receive the following responses: (1) strongly disagree (N=7); (2) disagree (N=9); (3) neutral (N=15); (4) agree (N=11); (5) strongly agree (N=8). What is the median level of agreement with the statement in our sample?

```Rout
- The number of cases is even so there is no single median observation (p. 64).
- We can still use the median observation formula: (n+1)/2
- Since (50+1)/2 = 25.5, we recognize that the median lies between the 25th and 26th observations.
- 7+9 = 16 is the sum of the number of people in the first 2 categories; 16 < 25
- 7+9+15 = 31 is the sum of the number of people in the first 3 categories: 31 > 26
- Since the total number of people in the first 3 categories is greater than 26, the median agreeement is "neutral."
```
* 7.4: Notice that our median calculations in the previous 2 examples presumes that there is a logical ordering of the categories.
* 7.5: In both of these examples, the mode would also have been a meaningful number (and would have been equal to the median; convince yourself!).
* 7.6: The median can also be used as a measure of central tendency or typicality for interval and ratio level variables (pp. 64-68).
* 7.7: Suppose we study the last 7 people to be released from the local prison; our goal is to calculate the median time served in prison (in years) before release.

```Rout
- Data: 7,3,9,5,2,2,8
- Sorted data: 2,2,3,5,7,8,9
- Median Observation: (n+1)/2 = (7+1)/2 = 8/2 = 4
- This means the score of the (sorted) 4th observation is the median: 5
- So the median time served in prison for our sample is 5 years.
- Notice that the mode of this distribution is 2. 
```
* 7.8: A DWI checkpoint was set up for 1 hour last Friday night. The blood alcohol content levels for the 8 people who were cited for DWI were recorded. Calculate the median blood alcohol content level for the sample.

```Rout
- Data: 0.12,0.09,0.15,0.13,0.09,0.1,0.11,0.12
- Sorted data: 0.09,0.09,0.1,0.11,0.12,0.12,0.13,0.15
- Median observation: (8+1)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5
- Since there is no 4.5th observation, we have to look at both the 4th and 5th observations: 0.11 and 0.12.
- Standard practice is to find the midpoint between the two middle observations.
- In this case, the midpoint would be (0.11+0.12)/2 = 0.23/2 = 0.115.
- So, the median blood alcohol level would 0.115.
```
* 7.9: Notice that in this example, there is no single mode since 0.09 occurs 2 times and 0.12 occurs two times.
* 7.10: This means the distribution is *bimodal*.

#### Solution to Last Week's Practice R Exercise

* Enter the New York City murders (1997-2003) and years from the table above.

* For this analysis, do you think the mean or the median would be a better measure of central tendency? Why?

### Lesson 6 - Thursday 2/13/25

#### Topic 7 (Continued)

* 7.11: I want to make one last point about the sample mode and median. There are times when we have incomplete data as in Problem 4.7 in this week's practice questions. It is still possible in some instances to make progress in estimating the mode and median when some of the data are missing. Here is an example dataset with measures of the speed with which 9 cars passed a speeding camera. One of the observations was missing, however.

```Rout
- Data: 57,52,63,48,52,52,59,58, ?
- Sorted Data: 48,52,52,52,57,58,59,63, ?
- Notice that it doesn't matter what the missing value is. The mode will still be 52.
- The middle position of the distribution of 10 cases is (9+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5.
- To estimate the median, we need to identify the 5th observation in the sorted dataset.
- If the missing case has a low value, say 45, the median would be 52.
- If the missing case has a high value, say 70, the median would be 57.
- This means that the median could be no lower than 52 and no greater than 57.
- We don't know the exact number but we know it must lie within that range.
```

#### Topic 8 Begins Here

* 8.1: The arithmetic average or mean (pp. 68-71) is an important measure of central tendency.
* 8.2: The mean considers the precise value of each score in estimating the "typical" score.
* 8.3: An average is based on the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores (equation 4.2 on page 68).
* 8.4: Consider the following example of a set of recidivism risk scores:

```Rout
Data: 7.7, 8.1, 4.5, 3.2, 7.5, 8.8, 5.1
Sum of the Scores: 7.7+8.1+4.5+3.2+7.5+8.8+5.1 = 44.9
Number of Scores: 7
Average or Mean Score: 44.9/7 = 6.414286 (or 6.414)
```

*Note*: see discussion of rounding on page 71. The rounding rule we will follow this semester is that intermediate calculations should not be rounded. Some rounding will be inevitable due to the limits of your calculators but intermediate calculations should be as precise as possible. Your final result when solving a problem can be rounded (usually to the 3rd decimal place).

* 8.5: There are two different ways to write the equation used to calculate the mean, $\overline{X}$. The book emphasizes the first way but both are acceptable and both are regularly used:

<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig19.png" width="200px">
</p>


*Note*: the examples we have used so far rely on the first equation (which is what is used in the book). However, here is the example solved above but now based on the second formula:

```Rout
Data: 7.7, 8.1, 4.5, 3.2, 7.5, 8.8, 5.1
Sum of the Scores: 7.7+8.1+4.5+3.2+7.5+8.8+5.1 = 44.9
Number of Scores: 7
Average or Mean Score: 1/7 x 44.9 = 6.414286 (or 6.414).
```
* 8.6: It is often useful to compare the mean and the median. Let's calculate the median on the same dataset:

```Rout
Data: 7.7, 8.1, 4.5, 3.2, 7.5, 8.8, 5.1
Sorted Data: 3.2, 4.5, 5.1, 7.5, 7.7, 8.1, 8.8
Number of Scores: 7
Middle Position: (7+1)/2 = 8/2 = 4
Score at the 4th position: 7.5 (this is the median)
```

* 8.7: The mean and median will often be very close to each other -- but sometimes not.
* 8.8: New Term: A *distribution* refers to the way the cases or units in a study are allocated across the categories. For example, in a sample of people sentenced to prison, we might have a variable that measures the most serious offense for which each offender was convicted. The values for this variable could be: (1) violent; (2) property; (3) drug; or (4) other. When we consider the number of cases in each category is the variable's distribution. The chart below shows the distribution of the most serious conviction offense variable for a sample of 1000 inmates.

* 8.9: If there are *outliers* (pp. 73-74) or the data are *skewed* (page 77), the variable's distribution will be affected. In these situations, there will be larger differences between the two statistics. Generally, in these situations, the median is regarded as a better measure of central tendency or typicality.
* 8.10: We have already discussed outliers but we have not considered the issue of *skewness*. Let's consider two *histograms* (a histogram is a type of chart (pp. 34-40 in Chapter 3 discusses histograms) that summarizes the *distribution* of a variable:
<p align="center">
<img src="/gfiles/fig21.png" width="850px">
</p>
* 8.11: The histogram on the left shows a *symmetric* distribution (IQ scores famously have symmetric distributions); symmetric means that the left half of the distribution is a mirror image of the right half. The other two charts reveal distributions that are skewwed in different ways. 
* 8.12: When the distribution is symmetric, the mean and median will be the same value. When the distribution is skewed the mean and median will be different (as shown in the figure above).
